/// Segments are read off the timeline rather than from a stored marker, using

/// number, notes, buddy, divemaster, diver role, boat, operator, dive centre,
/// trip, course, rating, favourite, weighting, statistics exclusions and
/// import provenance. Copying the dive row wholesale and clearing only a

/// its timings, depths and temperatures, the deco and CCR settings it was run
/// on, the water and weather it happened in, the computer that recorded it,
/// and its site -- both halves happened in one place. Timings and surface
