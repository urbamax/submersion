/// put the surface (y = 0) above the stop depth (y = -6), so the band occupies
/// the area above the bar. A below-bar fill cannot express this: fl_chart's
/// painter draws the below-bar area and then erases the entire above-line
/// region to clean up the cut-off overdraw, which wipes exactly the area the
/// band needs.
/// [fillColor] overrides [decoStopBandColor] for an overlaid source's own
/// band, so two computers' deco-stop obligations read as distinct washes
/// instead of stacking identically.
