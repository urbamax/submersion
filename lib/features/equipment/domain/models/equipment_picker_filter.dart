/// Narrows the Add Equipment picker, requested in #1576 for divers with large
/// inventories.
///
/// Deliberately NOT [EquipmentFilterState], the Equipment page's filter, for
/// two reasons:
///
/// - That filter's status axis decides which provider the list reads (active,
///   service-due, or one status). The picker reads exactly one provider,
///   `activeEquipmentProvider`, so both axes here are pure client-side
///   narrowing over that single result.
/// - Sharing state would mean filtering the Equipment page silently filtered
///   the dive picker, which is not what either surface's control implies.
///
/// There is no service-due axis: it needs the service-clock providers the
/// picker never loads, and "needs service" is not how a diver picks the gear
/// they actually dived.
///
/// [EquipmentStatus.retired] is absent from the picker by construction
/// (`getActiveEquipment` excludes it, per #636), so it is never offered.
/// [EquipmentStatus.spare] is absent too wherever the caller sets
/// `EquipmentPickerSheet.hideSpare` (#1803).
