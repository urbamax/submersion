/// The glyph that stands for [type] everywhere it appears: the equipment list,
/// the equipment detail header, the dive-edit gear row, and the equipment
/// picker sheet.
///
/// The switch is exhaustive on purpose. Four copies of this mapping used to
/// live in those four files, two of them ending in a generic fallback, so a
/// new equipment type silently rendered as a backpack in half the app while
/// the compiler stayed quiet. With no default arm, the next type added to
/// [EquipmentType] is a build error here instead.
///
/// Issue #1189 reported that the glyphs "don't really fit the equipment": most
/// types pointed at a metaphor rather than the object, and the two exposure
/// suits shared one hanger. Three sources answer that, tried in this order:
/// a shape drawn for Submersion when no icon font has the object at all
/// ([SubmersionIcons]); a dive glyph already sitting unused in the bundled
/// Material Design Icons font ([MdiIcons]); and a Material icon where the
/// object is generic enough to have one.
///
/// No tallies here on purpose: every type added to [EquipmentType] moves them,
/// and a stale count in a comment is worse than none when someone is checking
/// icon coverage. `test/core/icons/vendored_icon_font_coverage_test.dart` is
/// what actually holds each glyph to the font it names.
