/// the submodule advances. Two earlier rounds of this feature each added a
/// hardcoded entry for one more family (#961 for Shearwater, #1400 for three
/// Suunto models) and each left every other model on the warning path with its
/// bytes sitting unread in the database; #1436 replaced the tables outright.
///
/// Second, hand the bytes to `parseRawDiveData`. Almost every vendor's
/// `ZRAWDATA` is already in the exact layout libdivecomputer's parsers expect,
/// because MacDive downloaded it through libdivecomputer too. Shearwater is
/// the one known exception ([_rawPrePasses]): its stream is still transport
/// compressed, so [ShearwaterRawDecompressor] has to reverse two passes first.
///
/// Nothing about that resolution proves the bytes belong to the parser it
/// selected, so [RawProfileSanityCheck] gates the result. A dive whose parse
/// is rejected, or whose computer resolves to nothing, counts toward one
/// aggregated [ImportWarning] pointing at MacDive's XML export - exactly the
/// behaviour every unrecognised computer already had. See
/// `docs/import-formats/macdive-zsamples.md`.
///
/// Not every dive has `ZRAWDATA` at all: presence tracks how the dive entered
/// MacDive (a native download versus manual entry or a file import) rather
/// than the vendor. Every dive MacDive ever drew a profile for does have
/// `ZSAMPLES`, its own copy of that profile, which [MacDiveSamplesDecoder]
/// reads without the platform channel. It carries fewer channels than the raw
/// download (no per-cell ppO2, no deco settings, no events), so it is the
/// fallback rather than the first choice: a dive lands on it when it has no
/// `ZRAWDATA`, when the raw parse is rejected, or when this platform cannot
