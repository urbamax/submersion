/// Joined with [kDiveIdentitySeparator], the way the dive editor's own
/// collapsed section summaries read ("3 species · notes"), so a destructive
/// confirmation says what it is about to take without inventing a new shape
/// for it. Ordered from the work that takes longest to redo to the marks that
/// take a tap.

/// Null when there is nothing to say: an untouched recording, or a dive the
/// query could not find. Both leave the dialog exactly as it was before
/// (#1729).
