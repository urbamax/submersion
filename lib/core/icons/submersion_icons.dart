/// Neither Material Icons nor Material Design Icons has a wetsuit, a drysuit,
/// a BCD, a rebreather, a hood, a glove, a dive bootie, a reel, a DPV or a
/// regulator, so the equipment list reached for metaphors instead: a hanger
/// for both exposure suits, a hiking figure for boots, an infinity symbol for
/// a reel, a kick scooter for a DPV. Issue #1189 reported the result as icons
/// that "don't really fit the equipment".
///
/// The constants below are drawn in `tool/equipment_glyphs.py` and compiled
/// into `assets/fonts/submersion-equipment.ttf` by
/// `tool/build_equipment_icon_font.py`. Regenerate with:
///
/// ```sh
/// pip install fonttools
/// python3 tool/build_equipment_icon_font.py --verify
/// ```
///
/// Shipping them as a font rather than as SVG assets or custom painters keeps
/// [equipmentTypeIcon] returning [IconData], so all of its call sites keep
/// working and the glyphs inherit `IconTheme` size, colour, opacity and
/// directionality for free. Because every constant here is `const`, Flutter's
/// icon tree-shaker subsets the font at build time.
///
/// Code points sit in the Unicode Private Use Area and are assigned in the
/// declaration order of `tool/equipment_glyphs.py`. They are baked into the
/// committed font, so reordering that file without rebuilding the font would
/// silently swap glyphs.
