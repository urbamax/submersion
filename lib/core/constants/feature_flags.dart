/// This flag hides UI ONLY. All Lightroom services, providers, auth managers,

/// `lib/features/media/.../lightroom_*`, etc. are left untouched and keep

/// To re-enable once Adobe approves: set the default below to `true`. That
/// single change restores the media-sources entry point, the settings page +
/// route, and the per-dive / per-trip / photo-viewer scan and "Open in
