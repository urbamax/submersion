/// [TankPresets] is a const table with no BuildContext, and its rows are also
/// seeded into `tank_presets` as `TankPresetEntity` values whose `displayName`
/// exports and sync carry, so the English value stays the stable identifier
/// and screens resolve through here at render time, keyed on the slug in
/// [TankPreset.name] -- the same shape as `builtInDiveTypeName` for the seeded
/// dive types.
///
/// Domain call on the names: "AL80", "HP100", "LP85", "AL30 Stage" are
/// manufacturer/industry designations stamped on the cylinder and quoted in
/// every fill station price list. They are NOT translated, and every locale in
/// `lib/l10n/arb` already keeps them byte-identical. The only names that move
/// are the metric ones, where "Steel" is an ordinary material word ("Stahl
/// 10L", "Acier 10L", "Acciaio 10L"). All descriptions are prose and translate
/// in full.
