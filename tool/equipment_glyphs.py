"""Source of truth for the custom Submersion equipment glyphs.

Each glyph is composed on a 24x24 grid. TrueType fills with the nonzero winding
rule, so solid contours are wound clockwise and holes counter-clockwise. That
way the same path data renders identically in an SVG preview and in the
generated font.

Polygon winding is normalised by signed area rather than trusted from the
point order: a thick segment's offset points flip direction with the segment's
own direction, so a hand-ordered quad unions for a hose running right but
subtracts for one running left.
