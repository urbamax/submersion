// Integration test for libdc_descriptor_match against the REAL libdivecomputer

// descriptor.c so it exercises end-to-end BLE name -> descriptor resolution.
//
// Regression for issue #285: the Scubapro Galileo HUD advertises the short BLE
// name "HUD", but dc_filter_uwatec matches that alias against EVERY Uwatec/
// Scubapro descriptor. Without an alias->model mapping, the matcher falls back
// to the first family-level descriptor ("Aladin Sport Matrix", model 0x17)
// instead of the real model ("G2 HUD", model 0x42). The same alias-vs-product
// gap affects "Galileo 3" (product "G3"), "A1" ("Aladin A1") and "A2"
// ("Aladin A2"). Model codes below come from descriptor.c.
//
// Regression for issue #357: a Halcyon Symbios Handset (an all-digit BLE
// serial) was always identified as a HUD. Both Symbios descriptor rows
// ("Symbios HUD" model 1, "Symbios Handset" model 7) share dc_filter_halcyon,
// which matched the serial against the UNION {1, 7}, so both rows passed for
// any Symbios serial and the first (HUD) always won. dc_match_halcyon
// disambiguates by the serial's [4:6] digits (01 = HUD, 07 = Handset), so each
// row must filter on its own model. The serials below are synthetic: only the
// model-code digits [4:6] are significant, so the surrounding manufacture-date
// and unit-number digits are zeroed (the bug was first reported against real
// Symbios devices in issue #288).
//
// Regression for issue #1419: the Seac Tablet never appeared in a BLE scan.
// Its filter demanded a name of "Tablet" plus ASCII digits and nothing else,
// so any separator or letter in the advertised serial dropped the device.
