IHO Sea Area Harvester

Builds the offline body-of-water lookup table shipped with Submersion.

Nominatim cannot answer "which sea is this?": OpenStreetMap has no ocean or
sea polygons, so a reverse geocode anywhere in open salt water returns
nothing and a near-shore one snaps to the closest land feature. Almost every
dive happens in salt water, so the app carries its own table instead.

The source is IHO Sea Areas v3, the digitised form of "Limits of Oceans &
Seas, Special Publication No. 23" (IHO, 1953), published by the Flanders
Marine Institute under CC-BY 4.0:

    Flanders Marine Institute (2018). IHO Sea Areas, version 3.
    https://www.marineregions.org/ - https://doi.org/10.14284/323

The full layer is ~250 MB of coordinates. This script simplifies it to
roughly a megabyte, which is the resolution the runtime lookup actually
needs: the resolver already tolerates a few kilometres of coastline error
(see nearShoreKm in sea_area_index.dart), because IHO limits stop at the
legal boundary of a sea and dive-site coordinates are routinely recorded
from a beach or a moored boat.

# Coastline simplification, in degrees. 0.05 deg is ~5.5 km of latitude,
# and less longitude the further from the equator (~2.8 km at 60 degrees).
# So the error it introduces is not equal to the resolver's 4 km near-shore
# tolerance (nearShoreKm in sea_area_index.dart), but it sits in the same
# few-kilometre band -- which is the point: detail finer than that band is
# swallowed by the tolerance rather than changing which sea a dive site
# lands in, and it doubles the asset. Measured: halving this to 0.02 deg
# left all 30 curated sites and the 3,256-site corpus unchanged.
SIMPLIFY_TOLERANCE = 0.05

# Coordinates are stored to this many decimals: ~110 m, far below the
# simplification error, and it keeps the JSON a third smaller than the
# full float repr.
COORD_DECIMALS = 3

# Islands smaller than this are dropped from the polygon holes. The unit is
# square degrees, so the physical threshold shrinks towards the poles:
# ~615 km2 at the equator, ~310 km2 at 60 degrees. A dive site on a small
# island should report the sea around it, so only landmasses big enough to
# hold an inland dive site of their own (Cuba, Sicily, Iceland, Tasmania)
# are worth carving out. Keeping every islet instead grows the asset from
# ~1 MB to ~14 MB.

# the Adriatic, Aegean, Ionian and Tyrrhenian still win where they apply.

# Wikidata item per sea, so the shipped table can name a sea in the diver's
# own language. Hand-reviewed rather than matched by name at build time,
# and worth keeping that way: these were resolved by checking each
# candidate's coordinate falls inside that sea's own polygon, and three
# still came back wrong because a coordinate inside a polygon does not make
# an entity the polygon. "North Pacific Ocean" matched the Marshall
# Islands, which really are in the North Pacific; "Arctic Ocean" matched
# the polar land region; "Mediterranean Sea" matched the basin of
# surrounding countries. A second pass comparing each item's English label
# against the name here is what caught them.
#
# A handful legitimately differ in spelling from the IHO label and are
# correct: Ceram/Seram Sea, Gulf of St./Saint Lawrence, Malacca
# Strait/Strait of Malacca, and Rio/Rio de la Plata. "The Northwestern
# Passages" has no better item than the Northwest Passage route.
