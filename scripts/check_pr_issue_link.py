"""Require every pull request description to link the issue it relates to.

GitHub closes an issue on merge only when a closing keyword sits directly in
front of the issue number in the PR description (or in a commit message that
reaches the default branch). A number in the title, or a passing mention in
prose, links nothing. Issue #1800 found issues left open after the PR that
resolved them had merged, because the description never said `Closes #N`.

This guard makes the link a deliberate, checked part of every PR. It passes
when the description contains at least one of:

  * a closing link:     Close[sd] / Fix(e[sd]) / Resolve[sd] #N
  * a non-closing link: Refs / Part of / Related to #N

The non-closing forms exist for phased work and follow-ups that relate to an
issue without resolving it, so the issue is not closed early. When the branch
name encodes an issue number (`github-issue-1800-...`, `feature-request-1803-
...`, `fix/issue-12`), that particular issue must be one of the links: the
branch says which issue the work is for, so a description that forgets it is
almost certainly the #1800 mistake.

Bot-authored PRs (the version bump promote.yml opens, Dependabot) pass
unconditionally: they have no issue, and blocking them would stall the bump
PR's auto-merge and with it the beta train.

Text GitHub does not parse for links is ignored: HTML comments (where the PR
template keeps its examples, so an untouched template fails), fenced code
blocks and inline code spans. Indented code blocks are not stripped, because
telling them apart from nested list content needs a full Markdown parser.

Pure stdlib, so the workflow needs no dependency install.

Usage: check_pr_issue_link.py --body-file PATH [--branch NAME]
