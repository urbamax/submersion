# Installation

Submersion runs on iOS, Android, macOS, Windows, and Linux. Choose your platform below.

## Requirements

| Platform | Minimum Version |
|----------|-----------------|
| iOS | iOS 15+ |
| Android | Android 7+ (API 24) |
| macOS | macOS 12+ (Monterey) |
| Windows | Windows 10+ |
| Linux | Modern desktop distro |

### Development Requirements

To build from source, you'll need:

- **Flutter SDK** 3.5.0 or later
- **Dart SDK** 3.5.0 or later
- **Xcode** (for iOS/macOS builds)
- **Android Studio** (for Android builds)
- **Visual Studio** with C++ tools (for Windows builds)

## Install on Linux

Submersion ships for Linux as native packages as well as a tarball. The
packages resolve their own dependencies, register a desktop entry and icon,
and install udev rules so dive computers connected by USB are reachable
without any group membership or `usermod` step.

> **Distro requirement:** Submersion needs glibc 2.38 or newer, which means
> Ubuntu 24.04+, Debian 13+, Fedora 39+, Linux Mint 22+, Arch, or openSUSE
> Tumbleweed. Debian 12, Ubuntu 22.04, and RHEL 9 cannot run any current
> Submersion build. The packages install but the app will not start, and the
> tarball fails the same way, because three bundled libraries require
> GLIBC_2.38. Upgrading the distribution is the only path.

> **Where the packages are today:** the `.deb` and `.rpm` ship with every beta
> build at
> [submersion-app/beta-builds](https://github.com/submersion-app/beta-builds/releases).
> They reach the stable
> [Releases page](https://github.com/submersion-app/submersion/releases) with
> the next stable release; that page currently carries the tarball only.

<!-- tabs:start -->

#### **Debian / Ubuntu / Mint**

Download `Submersion-v<version>-Linux-amd64.deb` from the
[beta releases](https://github.com/submersion-app/beta-builds/releases):

```bash
sudo apt install ./Submersion-*-Linux-amd64.deb
```

#### **Fedora / RHEL**

Download `Submersion-v<version>-Linux-x86_64.rpm` from the
[beta releases](https://github.com/submersion-app/beta-builds/releases):

```bash
sudo dnf install ./Submersion-*-Linux-x86_64.rpm
```

#### **openSUSE**

The same `.rpm`. openSUSE ships zypper rather than dnf:

```bash
sudo zypper install ./Submersion-*-Linux-x86_64.rpm
```

#### **Other distros (tarball)**

```bash
tar xzf Submersion-*-Linux.tar.gz
./install.sh
```

`install.sh` reports any missing shared libraries with the exact command to
install them for your package manager, installs a desktop entry and icon under
`~/.local/share`, and links the binary into `~/.local/bin`. It prints the
command to install the udev rules, which needs root. `./uninstall.sh` reverses
all of it and leaves your dive log data alone.

Video compression is optional and uses `ffmpeg` if it is on your `PATH`. The
packages recommend it rather than requiring it, because Fedora ships `ffmpeg`
only through RPM Fusion. Without it, videos are uploaded at their original
size.

## Install from Source

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/submersion-app/submersion.git
cd submersion
```text
### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
flutter pub get
```dart
### 3. Generate Code

Submersion uses code generation for the database (Drift) and state management (Riverpod). Run:

```bash
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```xml
<div class="tip">
<strong>Tip:</strong> During development, use <code>dart run build_runner watch</code> to automatically regenerate code when files change.
</div>

### 4. Run the App

<!-- tabs:start -->

#### **macOS**

```bash
flutter run -d macos
```text
#### **iOS Simulator**

```bash
flutter run -d ios
```text
For a physical iOS device:

```bash
open ios/Runner.xcworkspace
# Configure signing in Xcode, then:
flutter run -d ios
```text
#### **Android**

```bash
flutter run -d android
```text
#### **Windows**

```bash
flutter run -d windows
```text
#### **Linux**

```bash
flutter run -d linux
```text
<!-- tabs:end -->

## Build for Release

### iOS

```bash
flutter build ios --release
```text
Then archive and distribute via Xcode.

### Android

```bash
# APK
flutter build apk --release

# App Bundle (for Play Store)
flutter build appbundle --release
```text
### macOS

```bash
flutter build macos --release
```text
### Windows

```bash
flutter build windows --release
```text
### Linux

```bash
flutter build linux --release
```text
## Troubleshooting

### Code Generation Fails

If `build_runner` fails, try:

```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```sql
### iOS Signing Issues

1. Open `ios/Runner.xcworkspace` in Xcode
2. Select the Runner project
3. Go to "Signing & Capabilities"
4. Select your development team
5. Ensure "Automatically manage signing" is checked

### Android SDK Issues

Make sure your Android SDK is properly configured:

```bash
flutter doctor
```text
Follow any recommendations to resolve issues.

### Missing Platform Dependencies

```bash
# macOS
xcode-select --install

# Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)
sudo apt-get install clang cmake ninja-build pkg-config libgtk-3-dev liblzma-dev

# Windows
# Install Visual Studio with "Desktop development with C++"
```
